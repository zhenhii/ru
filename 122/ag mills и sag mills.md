## Difference Between Sag Mill vs Ball Mill
&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;SAG mill make use of steel balls included with some large and hard rocks for grinding.These mills utilize the balls in making the large fragments of materials broken into pieces.The ball charge of a SAG mill is about 9% to 20%.This process takes place inside the large rotating drum of SAG mill which is filled with balls partially.A SAG mill is generally used as a primary or first stage grinding solution.Attrition between grinding balls and ore particles causes grinding of finer particles.SAG mills are characterized by their large diameter and short length as compared to ball mills.SAG mills are primarily used at gold,copper and platinum mines with applications also.China sag ball mill rubber pulp lifter liners bars FactoryThe world's most widely used rubber mill liners.Kosga has been providing products to the global mining industry for more than 40 years.Through the combination of experience and technology,Kosga's various AG,SAG and ball mill rubber linings are suitable for all existing brands in the market.Mill Critical Speed Determination.The &quot;Critical Speed&quot; for a grinding mill is defined as the rotational speed where centrifugal forces equal gravitational forces at the mill shell's inside surface.This is the rotational speed where balls will not fall away from the mill's shell.
