## Which mill to buy: G3102,G0728,or KBC 7x31,or ?
&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;Grizzly sells the G0730 (0731 with power feed) which looks very similar to the KBC mill you show.I have the previous version of the 0731,bought about 15 years ago as Grizzly G1008.They called it an A1SA mill,what that means I don't know.Mine was made in Taiwan and came standard with a coolant pump and tank.Secure your work with this 4 inch precision milling vise.The hardened and fixed jaw of the drill press milling vise is bolted from the top to enhance rigidity.
